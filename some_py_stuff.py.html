This is a multi line comment. 
Multi line comments are anything between sets of 3 apostrophe. 
Comments are ignored by the python interpreter and therefore do not execute at runtime. They are used for code documentation.

The print function outputs its argument as a string to the console. 
You can pass text directly to the function or you can pass it a string stored in a variable. 
'''</span>

<span class="s1">print(</span><span class="s2">&quot;This text was passed directly to the print function. Note the quotation marks.&quot;</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s1">var </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s2">&quot;This string was stored in a variable named var and passed to the print function. Note the lack of quotation marks in the function argument.&quot;</span>
<span class="s1">print(var)</span>

<span class="s2">''' 
The input command prints its argument to the screen and then waits for user input to proceed. 
If you don't pass it an arguement it will just wait for input. 
Input can easily be stored to a variable. 
'''</span>

<span class="s1">input(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter some text: &quot;</span><span class="s1">) </span><span class="s0">#With argument</span>

Lets use this to perform a task. We will create a small program that adds 2 numbers together.  
If you don't enter numbers you will get an error. I will cover how to prevent this issue later but for now dont worry about it. 
'''</span>

<span class="s1">num1 </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">int(input(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter number 1: &quot;</span><span class="s1">)) </span><span class="s0">#int() converts its argument to an integer (whole number). int(input()). It will produce an error if passed any value that cant be represented as an integer.</span>
<span class="s1">num2 </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">int(input(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter number 2: &quot;</span><span class="s1">))</span>
<span class="s1">num3 </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">num1 </span><span class="s3">+ </span><span class="s1">num2</span>
<span class="s1">print(</span><span class="s2">&quot;The sum is &quot; </span><span class="s3">+ </span><span class="s1">str(num3)) </span><span class="s0">#str() works the same as int() except it converts the argument into a string rather than an integer.</span>

<span class="s2">''' 
Next i will show you how to make your own functions.  
To define a function we use def then the function name when in parentheses we place any arguments we wish to use. 
It is possible to use an undeclared number of functions but I'll keep it simple for now. 
'''</span>

<span class="s4">def </span><span class="s1">divide_float(x, y)</span><span class="s3">: </span><span class="s0">#Here we use def to define a function, name it divide_float and pass 2 arguments that gets stored as a variables called x and y. Arguments get separated by a comma. You need to place : at the end of this declaration</span>
    <span class="s1">div </span><span class="s3">= </span><span class="s1">int(x) </span><span class="s3">/ </span><span class="s1">int(y) </span><span class="s0">#Here we take the arguments stored as x and y, convert them to integers so we can perform math operations, divide them and store the answer in a variable named div. </span>
                          <span class="s0">#Note that the code inside the function is indented. This is so the function knows what is inside of it. Once the code reaches the same indentation level as where the function was declared it assumes that is the end of the function.</span>
    <span class="s4">return </span><span class="s1">float(div) </span><span class="s0">#Here is where the function returns a value. Functions dont have to return a value. If you do need to return a value you use return followed by what you want to return.</span>
                      <span class="s0">#A float is a floating point number or a number with a decimal value. float() works the same as str() and int().</span>
                      
<span class="s1">print(str(divide_float(input(</span><span class="s2">&quot;first number: &quot;</span><span class="s1">), input(</span><span class="s2">&quot;second number: &quot;</span><span class="s1">))))</span>
<span class="s2">''' 
The above line calls the function as an arguement for the print function. Functions arent run when they are located in your code rather they run when called. Think of defining a function as storing code to run later in a variable. 
So we have the print function getting called. As its argument we are passing in the function we made but converted into a string with str(). 
The arguments being passed to our divide_float function are input functions that will ask for user input when needed. The arguments are separated by a comma. 
If we run this code python will skip over the function definition and see the print function. It will try to read the argument and see that it is our function divide_float so it will call that function. 
It will see that that functions arguments are also functions (input) so it will run the two input() functions first. Lets say we put in 10 and 2. 
Now we have our arguments it goes back to running the divide_float function. divide_float(10, 2). 
Now we are running the indented code inside our function. div = x / y which with agrs is div = 10 / 2. 
Now the function returns the variable div but first it converts it into a float (decimal). 
Now the code jumps back out to the print function now that it has a value for its argument. It converts the value we returned from our function into a string with str() then prints it. 
print(str(divide_float(10, 2))) --&gt; print(str(5.0)) --&gt; print(&quot;5.0&quot;)
